"""
Forms for creating and deleting Entry objects.

This module contains two Flask-WTF form classes used when working with
Entry records:

- EntryForm: Used when creating or editing a Entry.
- EntryDeleteForm: Used to confirm deletion of a Entry.

Both forms use GOV.UK Frontend-styled WTForms widgets to match the
design system used in the application.

    A form used to add or edit an Entry.

    Fields
    ------
    name : StringField
        The human-readable name for the Entry. This is required
        and must be unique across all Entries for a given Entry.
    mystery_value : StringField
        Some mystery number on the Entry. Who knows what this
        is used for.
    submit : SubmitField
        A standard submit button.

    Custom Validation
    -----------------
    validate_name(field):
        WTForms automatically looks for methods named `validate_<fieldname>`
        and calls them when that field is validated.
        This method checks whether the chosen name already exists in the
        database and raises a ValidationError if so.

        Parameters
        ----------
        field : wtforms.fields.StringField
            The field object containing the value entered by the user.

        Raises
        ------
        ValidationError
            If an Entry already exists with the same name within the given register.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method uses SQLAlchemy to query the database.
        - `first()` returns the first matching Entry or None.
        - Raising a ValidationError tells WTForms that this field is invalid,
          and the error message is displayed to the user.

        A checkbox that the user must tick to confirm deletion.
